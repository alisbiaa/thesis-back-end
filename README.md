## Thesis - Back-End repository
### Description
The plan is to create a platform for the university, where I aim to mock the `StackOverflow` website that we all use to find answers to our questions.
It will be a web-based application. 

Categorized by `departments` and `subjects`. Just like a mini private library.
Mainly there will be three types of users: `administrative`, `teachers` and `students`.
The `student` will be allowed to ask questions and answer them. On the other hand, the `teacher` will be answering these questions or validating the existing correct ones.

The whole idea is to have a registry of all the valuable and important questions (problems) and to avoid repeating the same questions.

### Technologies 
Regarding the technologies, as mentioned above it will be a web-based application.
To simplify things I decided to work full-stack with JavaScript.
- Back-end : NodeJs ( express )
- Front-end : ReactJs
- Database : MongoDB
- Container : Docker
- Workflow : GitHub actions
